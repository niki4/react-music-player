# react-music-player
A simple music player utilizing React.JS

It was created after the workshop "[Everything You Should Know About React: The Basics You Need to Start Building](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-react-eaedf53238c4)" (for russian translate please visit [this page](https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/343022/)).

This example demonstrates the abilities of React.JS and JSX syntax for to generate a dynamic code (keep and change state, handle actions).


# installation
There are no installation steps. 

Using any modern browser you may open the site https://niki4.github.io/react-music-player/ to play (music) around. 

Yet you may open the source of `index.html` to look how it works inside. 
If you curious how the React works, I'd recommend you go through the source code and the tutorial listed above.


# usage
Just open any audio file (say, .mp3) from your disk and click Play button. Click Pause to stop.
